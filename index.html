        <h2>My Setup</h2>

<p>This is used and tested on <a href="">Aquamacs Emacs</a> but can easily be used with other Emacs distributions.</p>

<h2>Customizations</h2>

<p>Some packages like the Markdown editing one have been customized (generally in init.el) to use Font Lock sizing to make H1s, H2s and H3s different font sizes, and thus, more easily browsable.</p>

<h2>Build Your Own Lightsaber</h2>

<p>Unlike most open source projects on GitHub, Emacs setups are a bit different. I highly recommend forking this repo, but suggest you strike out on your own on customizing your fork without much worry of sending Pull Requests back to mine.  It isn't that they are unwelcome. Not at all! I just find that, as Neal Ford says, setting up Emacs is a very personal thing. It is like building your own Lightsaber. Only you know how to use your setup in the best possible way.</p>
